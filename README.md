# dCellCraft
godot reskin of cellcraft (which is open source - https://github.com/larsiusprime/CellGame--Open-Source-fork-of--CellCraft--/tree/master) intended for HTML5 export so it can be played on student chromebooks. Large portions of the source code were written in collaboration with GPT-4.

10/25/23 - the project is still very early development, not close to feature complete. We are able to move the cell by click and drag as well as collect one type of resource. There is also camera follow.
